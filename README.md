## Intro

## Updates / Log

### August 17, 2020

Started the project today, first project built with Angular in a few years but, getting spun up quickly. I have created 3 components a header, footer and body. I also chose the routing option when initializing the project, something which I do not actually think I need so I will probably need to remove that in the coming weeks.

#### Struggles

I didn't have too many struggles, though getting ```ngModel``` to work was a bit annoying and required me to import a form component to the root app component, there were a few places where it needed to be imported leading to some issues but I eventually got a working form going that let me log out an input. 

#### Next Time

Next time I want to dive in and rebuild my ugly Angular form to look more like the Bootstrap one I am using above in terms of layout. Then I might try doing some basic string interpolation to put a basic budget together. I also might look into removing the routing stuff I added today.

#### CLI Commands I Used / Learned

```
ng serve --open
```

Run the dev server and open a browser tab

```
ng g c [component name]
```

Generate all the boilerplate and files for a component named [component name]
